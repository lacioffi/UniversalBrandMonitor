This is a social image monitoring app for Splunk. It comes with the Splunk App and some data collectors (e.g. Twitter).

This was my TCC (undergrad conclusion project) for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at UFABC. I was mentored by Professor Francisco Isidro Massetto.
Feel free to use any part of this project in any way you like.
